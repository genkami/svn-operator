# svn-operator

The svn-operator is a simple, opinionated operator that has following features:

* Does not guarantee extremely high availability. (if an SVN server crashes, just wait for a second and retry.)
* Only basic authentication is allowed.
* Can manage users and repositories declaratively.
* Does not provide path-based authorization.
